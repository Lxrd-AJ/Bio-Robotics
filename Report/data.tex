The data handling is organised into 3 sections: The first being a mongodb datastore for all the incoming data from the flowers, the second being the dashboard for visualising the data available in the datastore and the last being a central server that communicates with a lora-module via serialport, parsing and saving the lora packets and also acting as a web-server to the dashboard.
