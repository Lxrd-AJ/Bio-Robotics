\begin{abstract}
The idea of this project was to create a device capable of ultra-low power sensing and ultra-low power transmission that is capable of harvesting the energy required for its operation from solar sources. The energy harvesting nature of the device would eliminate the significant operational expenditure required to replace batteries in periphery nodes after they have gone flat. As batteries are typically known for having relatively short operational lifetimes (<10 years), our design would instead use a super capacitor in order to store the energy required for operation. This type of “Zero-Energy Sensing” is a new idea with huge potential in the IoT field.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} product would be aimed toward outdoor sensing applications where typical wireless sensing networks could be useful. A specific example of its usage would be a soil moisture detector for monitoring crops. The idea of the Wireless Sunflower Network would be to design a cheap product that could be easily set up by someone unfamiliar with electronics in order to build the sensing network (a plug and play solution).
