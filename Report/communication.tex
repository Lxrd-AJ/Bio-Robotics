LoRa is a low power, long range telecommunication technology that is ideal for the type of energy stringent wireless networks being considered. The physical layer of LoRa (Long Range) is a proprietary spread spectrum technique derived from Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) and is owned by Semtech~\cite{borLORAforIOT}. The standard MAC layer protocol is LoRaWAN and is an open standard being developed by the LoRa Alliance~\cite{ouluPetajajarvi}. As this protocol is open source, ad hoc networks can be set up without having to wait for a network provider. The transmission distance, energy usage and data rate are all dependent on five configurable parameters. The Semtech data sheets~\cite{lora:sx1272/73} specify how these parameters affect power usage.  Semtech also offer a calculator~\cite{loraCALCULATOR} that may be used to test individual parameter sets.
